====================================================================================
It is the second extra practice in this semester. There should be about 10 freshmen joining this practice.
We cannot book the LG4204 for 2 hours because we submit the booking application late.

Hence, we will meet outside at the LG4204. Then, we will go to LG3003 for practising the footwork.

    <font color="red">(Today, we have not booked the LG3003. It is because the staff said that Anthony has booked the venue incorrectly by writing a wrong booking log book. Finally, we practice footwork outside the LG 4204.)</font>

Then, we will move back to LG 4204.


First, recall what we have done in the last extra practice and yesterday regular practice.

====================================================================================
It is the third extra practice in this fall semester. It will be hold by Anthony.

At this point, we already have two regular practices on 21-9-2016 (Wed) and 28-9-2016 (Wed).
We also have two extra practices on 26-9-2016 (Mon) and 29-9-2016 (Thur).
If you have missed our extra practices, you can revisit the material in this webpage.

**Reminder of the last extra practice**

#. suriashi. We have practised this at the beginning outside the LG 4204.

#. We have practised the 5-stages footwork. The 5th stage is **extremely** important. So you should always read Reference (2) (of 29-9-2016 (Thur) extra practice) for reference.

#. Please remember that all the participates with different levels will practice the same thing with **slightly** different. 
	| For example for the striking men practice, you may find that some seniors will cut from the top of the head while the juniors will cut from the back (You are not allowed to cut it small!).
	| It is because we need to focus on different things when we are at different stages. More in reference (1).
	| In addition, people are different. People are good at different things. So please take your own step/progress/speed during the progress. Simply follow others is not good for you.

#. We have practised men strike with kiai. In each round, only one person (i.e. the commander) will shout "1,2,3,...". After the commander has shouted, other shout "men". More in reference (2).
