==========================================================================
It is the second extra practice in this semester. There should be about 10 freshmen joining this practice.
We cannot book the LG4204 for 2 hours because we submit the booking application late.

Hence, we will meet outside at the LG4204. Then, we will go to LG3003 for practising the footwork.

    <font color="red">(Today, we have not booked the LG3003. It is because the staff said Anthony has booked the venue incorrectly by writing a wrong booking log book.)</font>

Then, we will move back to LG 4204. W
