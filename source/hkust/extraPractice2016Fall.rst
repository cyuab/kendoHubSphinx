Maintained by; Coleman YU

26-9-2016 (Mon), 0600pm-0800pm HKUST LG 4204
===============================================
Welcome, it is the first extra practice in this fall semester.
It will be hold by 2 senior members, namely Coleman and Anthony.
Another 3 senior members, namely Nero, Star and Ryan will come to help.

**The followings are the content of this extra practice.**

#. The basic structure of shinai (It represents a Japanese sword).

	| What does the rope in the top of shinai represent?
	| 38 inch sword for ladies while 39 inch sword for gentlemen
	
#. Kamae
	
	| Like having a normal walk and just stop.
	| Like having a wok (鑊) in the torso.
	| One fist between the torso and the shinai. Why? It allows you to escape from your opponent's attack.
	
#. Distances (Maai)

	| Three distances as stated in reference (1).
	|	1. Tōma (Tō-ma) — long distance
	|	2. Issoku ittō-no-maai (Itto-ma) — one-foot-one-sword distance also called chūma — middle distance
	| 	3. Chikama — short distance
	
#. Footwork (Ashi-sabaki)
	
	| suri-ashi (sliding footwork)
	| imagine an A4 paper between your right foot palm and the ground.
	| Left leg should never cross right leg.
	| Weight distribution: 60 (right): 40 (left), 50 (right): 50 (left)
	|	Someone will tell you to have 60% of weight on the right leg while 40% of weight on the left leg.
	|	Someone will tell you to have 50% of weight on the right leg while 50% of weight on the left leg.
	| 	In my opinion, it depends on the situation. You should try to vary the weight distribution to find out which one is better in the given circumstance.
	
#. Suburi

	| Swing without cutting a specific target.
	| What is it purpose?
	| A practice: Two Suburi swing and then One stepping footwork to move forward.
	
#. The *basic* men cut in reference (2).

	| It is our target in October.
	| It is completely fine/natural that you cannot do it now.

29-9-2016 (Thur), 0500pm-0600pm HKUST outside LG 4204, 0600pm-0700pm HKUST LG 4204
====================================================================================
It is the second extra practice in this semester. 
There should be about 10 freshmen joining this practice.
We cannot book the LG4204 for 2 hours because we submit the application late.

Hence, we will meet outside at the LG4204. Then, we will go to LG3003 for practising the footwork for the first hour.
Then, we will move back to LG 4204 for the later hour.

.. raw:: html

    <font color="red">(Today, we have not booked the LG3003. It is because the staff said that Anthony has booked the venue incorrectly by writing a wrong booking log book. Finally, we practice footwork outside the LG 4204.)</font>

First, recall what we have done in the last extra practice (26-9-2016) and yesterday regular practice (28-9-2016).

**Reminder/Comment of the last extra practice.**

#. Kamae (The upper body part)
	
	| 4 things
	| 1. The arms should be relaxed. As release (c.f. hea in Canotnese) as possible.
	| 2. Positive slope and never negative slope of the shinai. The actual slope depends on the height of your opponent.
	| 3. One fist between the torso and the holding.
	| 4. Center line. You cannot see the *center* now. After you practise for a longer time, you can see the center line more clearly.
	
#. Footwork
	
	| 2 things
	| Never 八字腳 (i.e. You foot should not be placed as a Chinese character 八 shape.) Shoud be parallel (a.k.a. 11).
	| Cross leg (The left foot palm should always follow the right foot palm.)
	
#. Holding

	| 10101 for the five fingers for both hands. 1 represents stress while 0 represented less stress. Counting from the last finger as 1.
	| The last 3 (or 2) fingers are extremely important.
	| Never hold the shinai as doraemon.
	
**Reminder/Comment of the last regular practice.**

#. Different between the sliding men taught by Ken senpai and the "The *basic* men cut in reference (1)" in last extra practice.
#. When we hold the shinai, the left arm should have a little bit bend.

**The followings are the content of this extra practice.**

#. We will revise the materials of the last extra practice and the last regular practice.

#. We will introduce the inner side and outer side of the shinai. More in Reference (1).

#. We will practice the footwork. More in Reference (2).

====================================================================================
It is the 3th extra practice. It will be hold by Coleman and Anthony.

To begin with, please be noticed that we have announced the details of the 2016 Fall Mass Purchase.

We also have two extra practices on 26-9-2016 (Mon) and 29-9-2016 (Thur).

**Reminder/Comment of the last extra practice**

#. suri-ashi. We have practised this at the beginning outside the LG 4204.

#. We have practised the 5-stages footwork. The 5th stage is **extremely** important.

#. Please remember that all the participates with different levels will practice the same thing with **slightly** different. 
	| For example for the hitting men practice, you may find that some seniors will cut from the top of the head while the juniors will cut from the back (You are not allowed to cut it small!).
	| It is because we need to focus on different things when we are at different stages. More in reference (1).
	| In addition, people are different. People are good at different things. So please take your own step/progress/speed during the practice. Simply follow others is not good for you.

#. We have practised men strike with kiai. In each round, only one person (i.e. the commander) will shout "1,2,3,...". After the commander has shouted, other shout "men". More in reference (2).

6-10-2016 (Thur), 0400pm-0700pm HKUST LG 3002
====================================================================================
It is the 4th extra practice. The 0400pm-0600pm session will be hold by Anthony while the 0600pm-0700pm session will be hold by Nero.
Besides, Karen senpai , Zero and Alec may go to help.

**Reminder/Comment of the last regular practice (Wed)(5-10-2016).**

#. I have found that some of the beginners misunderstand the Fumikomi Men taught by Ken senpai.
	| Fumikomi (Stamp)
	| The Fumikomi Men taught by Ken senpai is as follows
	|	1. Raise up the shinai by raising up your body a little bit. 
	|	"raising up your body" refers to the motion that you want to take something at the shelf in a high position but you cannot reach it. So you raise and extend your body to try to take it.
	|	2. At this moment, your shinai has been raised and your body has not moved yet.
	|	3. Launching your left leg to push the right leg while swinging down the shinai.
	|
	| Some beginners do an advanced version.
	|	They do not do the above 1st and 2nd steps. They simply do the 3th step and try to raise the shinai when they launch the left leg.
	|	It is very difficult. Some of the senior members will try to do this version as a practice. However, beginners should follow the version of Ken senpai instead of the others.

**The followings are the content of this extra practice**

#. Kamae

#. The five stages of footwork as covered in 29-9-2016 (Thur) extra practice.

#. okuri-ashi (送足) with left foot at front
	| 1 beat version, small and frequently, the normal version
	| 2 beat version, large and slowly. 1st beat: push from your left leg. 2nd beat: pull from your right leg.
	
	
#. okuri-ashi with right foot at front
	| Same as above

#. Ayumi-ashi (A type of footwork akin to normal walking)
	| 2 beat version, large and slowly. 
	| 1st beat: push from your left leg to launch the right leg
	|
	| 2nd beat: Pull from the right leg and hence the leg leg cross the right leg and then use the right leg (It is at the behind now.) to push the left leg.
		
#. Two people stand in the Issoku ittō-no-maai.
	| Feel the connection between you and your partner.
	| When one side moves forward, other moves backward to keep the distance 

#. Swing the shinai with footwork
	| 1. At the normal kamae position. (left leg follows right leg)
	| 2. Raise your shinai stationary.
	| 3. Push from the left leg (the left leg do not move) to move the right leg forward and swing down the shinai.
	| 4. Use the left leg to draw the right leg while swing up the shinai and place your right leg behind the left leg.
	| 5. At this moment, the kamae position is reversed. (right leg follows left leg)

#. Fumikomi-ashi practice
	| Move in Reference (1)
	| More in Reference (2)
	
#. Jumping suburi
	| Teach by Zero
	| 1. Normal Kamae (With left leg follows the right leg with normal separation)
	| 2. Jumping upward while swinging up the shinai
	| 3. When you fall, swing down the shinai at the men level
	| 4. When you land on the group, your left leg follow the right leg and the separation between them is large.
	| 5. This time, jump upward again while you swing up the shinai and move the left leg from backward to forward.
	| 6. When you fall, swing down the shinai at men level
	| 7. When you land on the group, your right leg follow the left leg and the separation between them is large.
	| 8. Repeat the procedure for steps 4 to 8 by changing the leading leg using the step 5.
	
#. Touching the knee 
	| Teach by Karen senpai
	| You can find that using fumikiri and fumikomo make you easier to touch the opponent's knee

**For fun, you can watch them in this weekend**

#. You can watch the video in Reference (3) to feel the excitement of kendo.

#. You can watch the video in Reference (4) to know how other people practise/pursue kendo in other place.

**Some news**

2016 Fall mass purchase
	| https://goo.gl/forms/kmmQy6VOpfXebn3R2

日本武道巡禮2016
	| 6-11-2016
	| https://www.facebook.com/events/1795348890751562/

**Reminder/Comment of the last regular practice (Sat)(8-10-2016).**

#. You should observe the difference between the the sliding men taught by Ken senpai and the one taught by me.
	| Ken senpai version
	| 	Raise the shinai without moving.
	|	Suri-ashi for one step and swing down the shinai
	| My version
	|	Raise the shinai using the launching of the left leg. We push the right leg at the same time.
	|	Swing down the shnai using the pulling from the right leg.
	
#. Must have a rectangle between two foot palms.
	| The top right corner is the heel of the right palm.
	| The bottom left corner is the thumb of the left palm.
	
**The followings are the content of this extra practice**

#. Coleman will distribute 10 copies of book stated in Reference (1). 
	| If you want to have the soft copy, you can find it under the session "Reference".
	| If there are too many people, I will print more of it and bring it next time.
	| The book in Reference (1) is a good book. It also serves as a dictionary to understand some terminologies in kendo. 
	| I do not suggest you to read the whole book at this stage (i.e. learning kendo for 1 month). Just flip it at your leisure time.

.. raw:: html

    <font color="red">(I have distributed 8 copies today. Star has also taken one.)</font>

	
#. We will first revise the footwork taught in last extra practice (6-10-2016).
	| okuri-ashi (送足) with left foot at front
	| okuri-ashi with right foot at front
	| Swing the shinai with footwork

#. Frog jump
	
#. Explain the mechanism/basic flow of Kihon-Uchi (basic striking or cutting)
	| To begin with, I will explain some important terms in the footwork part.
	|	1. Fumikiri: push-off or the leap forward using the left foot when in chudan
	|	2. Fumikomi: stamp on the floor with the entire sole of the right
	|	3. Hikitsuke: the act of snapping the rear foot up.
	|	In conclude, we use fumikiri to drive off from your left foor at the Issoku ittō-no-maai, moving your right foot word as a result of shortening the distance.
	|	Perform fumikomi and strike at the same time
	|	Hikitsuke just occur after the strike and stamp (Fumikomi). Without hikitsuke the action `cutting' cannot be completed.
	|	(c.f. You cannot cut a bread by simply pushing down from the top. You have to slice it)
	|	The remainder is when and how to raise the shinai.
	|	1. You can raise the shinai stationary.
	| 	2. You can raise the shinai when you execute the Fumikiri.
	|	3. You can move your right foot forward using the power of your left foot without lifting your shinai. 
	|	Then, raise your shinai above your head as you bring your left foot by straightening the right leg (Hikitsuke).
	| Reference (2)
	
#. Tobikomi men (We call Men-Uchi in our club) with an opponent holding the shinai
	| Do not use too much force.
	| The partner can suddenly remove the target to see that whether the attack side uses too much force.
	| Tobikomi means jumping/diving to hit the men.
	| Start at the "issokuittou no maai"
	| Two version
	| 1. The 5th stage of the Fumikomi footwork and then suri-ashi
	| 2. And different version in reference (3) and reference (4)
	
	
#. Stationary Men
	| Gilbert: The cutting of the freshmen is not good.

#. Use the forearm to measure the holding position
	| Taught by Gilbert
	| You can also read it in p.14 in reference (1)

#. Forward Men and backward Men	
	| Star: The motodachi move first, the attack side then follow

#. Sliding men with partner, no blocking
	| Ken senpai version
	|	1. Raise the shinai stationary
	|	2. Push from left leg and swing down the shinai
	|	3. Then pull the left leg by right leg
	| Coleman version
	|	1. Push from the left leg and raise the shinai at the same time.
	|	2. Pull the left leg from the right leg and swing down the shinai
	| Star: an mixture of the above two.
	|	1. Push from the left leg and raise the shinai at the same time.
	|	2. The pushing is not stop yet and hence your right leg is still moving.
	|	3. Swing down when your right leg stops moving forward
	|	4. Then pull the left leg by right leg

====================================================================================
It is the 6th extra practice. It will be hold by Coleman. Anthony, Ryan and Ali will come to help.

We have already learnt many basic skills in kendo. You should have a brief idea of the mechanism of the actions.
In the yesterday regular practice, Ken senpai has taught us about sayu men. He has also illustrated how to do the forward and backward sayu men.

Understanding the principles is easy while doing/implement them is difficult.
So, we need to practice continuously.
