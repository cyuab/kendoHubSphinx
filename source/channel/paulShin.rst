#. Omote vs. Ura 

#. Which side of the shinai you should use to execute the waze.

#. Your shinai and your opponent's shinai are usually touching on the omote side.

#. When you look down your shinai, your left side is the omote side while the right side is the ura side.

#. Omote = outside while Ura = inner 

#. The blade is facing up when you wear the katana.

#. The name is written in the omote side in the middle of the holding.

#. The disadvantage of displaying the katana in omote side is that you cannot use sword easily at the emergency condition.

#. Example of using short form in commander: kote suriage men on the omote side
	| I use my omote side of the shinai to block his kote strike and hit his men.
