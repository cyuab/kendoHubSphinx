Preface
=========

I have background on computer science, physics and mathematics. For me, kendo is very difficult. I find that the dependency of different parts in kendo is high.
For example, in order to improve a bad habit in kendo, we always need to improve several minor habits in different components.  
It is similar to that case that we need to go into different classes or files in other to fix a single bug. It is a bad programming habit.
But it is a intrinsic property of kendo or any sports.

In addition, I always find that there are undefined terms in kendo such as "Tenouchi" and "ki ken tai ichi".
I know that they are important components for kendo but I am not crystal clear of what they really are.
I find that it is similar to the case of "inertia". We use "inertia" to explain things but we do not know what it is.

In conclude, I hope I can improve my kendo by building this website. The things in kendo are scattered but related.
This website serves as a hub to gather these components.
	
It is very likely that my ideas and opinions on kendo are wrong given that my time on kendo is not long. Please correct me by reaching me in email.
