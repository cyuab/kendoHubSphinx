This video demonstrates how to hit men in 3 different ways/levels.
They are *basic*, *intermediate* and *advance*.
Besides, there is a interesting advertisement in the middle of the video.

*basic:*

1. Start at far distance (toma), which is a good distance. It uses the suriashi footwork to approach the opponent. The left palm does not need to raise too much.

2. Kiai

3. Step in to attacking distance, which is namely as "issokuittou no maai". It means "one step one cut distance".

4. At the attacking distance, (raise and push the right leg) and (raise the shinai as big so you can see your opponent (i.e. over head)).

5. Draw the left leg and do the men strike. Pay attention to the "tenouchi" (i.e. holding). Cut to the chin.

6. Return to the Kamae

7. Return to the attacking distance

*advertisement:*

They use suriashi and wood sword to strike men.
In details, launching right leg while raising shinai.
Then, drawing left leg while dropping shinai.

The girl at 04:51 seem doing men in different way. Her upper arm drops first. Then the lower arm drops.

The kirakashi is different from what I have learnt. The left hand is not in the middle.

At 05:26, the RHS uses the shinai pointing to his right to defence.
Then hits men from his inner side.
After that, it seem he hits kote from his outer side.
Then he launches right leg (left leg has not been moved) and hits men from his outer side.

*immediate:*

1. After arriving the attacking distance, we should not move the left leg to swing the shinai. Just launch the right leg.

2. Use suriashi to pass through the opponent.

Then, in the demonstration.

At 08:40, the first men is same as what he has taught.
At 08:44, the second men employs the "drawing left leg to swing the shinai".
The 3rd and 4th men are same as the 2nd men.

*advance:*

1. Use small movement to swing the shinai.

2. From the far distance, step in.

3. As we leap forward, instead of bringing the shinai over head. Pushing from left leg, leap forward and strike with small action without making a huge swing.

4. Raise the shinai so that the tip is above your opponent' head. Be aware that the shinai should not point backward. Must stay forward as shown in 09:51.

5. As in the large version, we still need to cut to the chin in order to make nice solid strike. When we cut, we time the hands and feet together.

6. Carrying your body weight with your feet

7. Moving the feet before hand

8. Small does not mean fast

9. The most important is "all together is one"

Then, in the demonstration.

The 1st and 2 nd men:

Approach and stand still and does not "drawing left leg to swing the shinai".
The 3th and 4th seems to use  "drawing left leg to swing the shinai".

In the comments, someone mentions other kendo channels namely "ItohisaTakano's", "Let'sKendo's channels" and "ZNKR 
".
