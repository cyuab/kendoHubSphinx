29-9-2016 (Thur), 0500pm-0600pm HKUST outside LG 4204, 0600pm-0700pm HKUST LG 4204
====================================================================================
It is the second extra practice in this semester. There should be about 10 freshmen joining this practice.
We cannot book the LG4204 for 2 hours because we submit the booking application late.

Hence, we will meet outside at the LG4204. Then, we will go to LG3003 for practising the footwork.

.. raw:: html

    <font color="red">(Today, we have not booked the LG3003. It is because the staff said that Anthony has booked the venue incorrectly by writing a wrong booking log book. Finally, we practice footwork outside the LG 4204.)</font>

Then, we will move back to LG 4204.


First, recall what we have done in the last extra practice and yesterday regular practice.

**Reminder of the last extra practice.**

	| 4 things
	| 1. The arms should be relaxed. As release (c.f. hea in Canotnese) as possible.
	| 2. Positive slope and never negative slope of the shinai.
	| 3. One fist between the torso and the holding
	| 4. Center line.
	
#. Footwork
	
	| 2 things
	| Never 八字腳 (i.e. You foot should not be placed as Chinese character 八.) Parallel (a.k.a. 11).
	| Cross leg (The left foot palm should always follow the right foot palm)
	
#. Holding

	| 10101 for the five fingers for both hands. 1 represents stress while 0 represented less stress. Counting from the last finger as 1.
	| The last 3 (or 2) fingers are extremely important.
	| Never hold the shinai as doraemon.

**Reminder of the last extra practice**

#. suriashi. We have practised this at the beginning outside the LG 4204.

#. We have practised the 5-stages footwork. The 5th stage is **extremely** important.

#. Please remember that all the participates with different levels will practice the same thing with **slightly** different. 
	| For example for the hitting men practice, you may find that some seniors will cut from the top of the head while the juniors will cut from the back (You are not allowed to cut it small!).
	| It is because we need to focus on different things when we are at different stages. More in reference (1).
	| In addition, people are different. People are good at different things. So please take your own step/progress/speed during the progress. Simply follow others is not good for you.

#. We have practised men strike with kiai. In each round, only one person (i.e. the commander) will shout "1,2,3,...". After the commander has shouted, other shout "men". More in reference (2).
