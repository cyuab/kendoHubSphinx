#. No: start outside of striking distance; take a step towards their opponent, take another step whilst raising the shinai and another one when bringing it down.

#. Yes:  to step into range maintaining chudan kamae then raise and lower the shinai in a continuous movement, simultaneously taking a second step to strike the target. 

#. Good start is to practice suburi, concentrating on making the up and down movement in the timing of one (ichibyoshi). 

#. You can also practise men drills stepping into your own uchima distance without lowering or lifting the point of your shinai and then raise it as you push off from the left foot and bring it sharply down on your opponent’s men as your right foot hits the floor.
